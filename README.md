per-se-ver-ance: noun steadfastness in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success.

This is the beginning of my journey.

Going from nothing to something  - harnessing my internal desire for success, acceptance, and self appreciation. I'm out to prove to myself that I can be challenged, overcome, and succeed. I plan on using my skills honed from a neverending desire to learn to promote love, happiness, and spirtual wealth. 

Today is a new beginning.
